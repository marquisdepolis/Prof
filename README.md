# Prof
Some fun code for investment analyst training, called Prof because it, hopefully, teaches you. Or at least guides you to teach yourself. Choose a public company ticker and a quarter (eg MSFT 2018,2), and it creates specific questions to answer, predict what you think will happen, and then look at the next time period to see what actually happened.

This is a work in progress proof of concept. The idea is to enhance it by linking to a database and creating better simulations to practice management decision making.
